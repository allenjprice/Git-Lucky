There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for each heading. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

## What is it? ##
Git Lucky is the "I'm Feeling Lucky" button GitHub deserves.

## Who needs it? ##
If you're interested in getting started with open source contributions but aren't sure where to begin, Git Lucky is here for you.

## What does it do? ##
Git Lucky will rocket you past the daunting first step of open source contribution: finding a repo to start with. Tell Git Lucky what language you work in, and you'll get back a randomly selected GitHub issue. Don't like the issue presented to you? Hit "Nope" to get a new one. When you find an issue that you think you can tackle, hit "Go for it!" to go to the issue's page and dive into the repo.

## Why do I need Git Lucky? ##
Making open source contributions is productive for developers of all skill levels, but it's a tough habit to start. There are so many repositories out there, and searching for problems in need of a solution can be a daunting task. 

Git Lucky solves this problem by showing you only one issue. If you think you can tackle it, then you can go for it! If you're not interested in the problem, just hit "Nope" to see a different one.
